## Environments

We use environments to isolate the project libraries and eliminate unintended side-effects to other projects.
Four ways to create an evironment:
- Venv (with python 3)
- virtualenv (pip install virtualenv)
- anaconda (for binaries, recommended for windows)
- pipenv (pip install pipenv)
On Windows it is advisable to use anaconda.

Below an Example on how to create such an environment with virtualenv

Got to your Project Folder and create an environment: 

```
virtualenv -p python3 spielwiese
```

Activate the evironment:
```
Linux / Mac: source spielwiese/bin/activate
Windows: ./spielwiese/Scripts/activate
```
## Packages 
For Machine Learning multiple python Packages provide preimplemented funtionalties. If you want to use those packages you need to install them first. 
```
pip install <pandas> oder pip install â€“r <requirements.txt>
```
## Run a Script
```
python spielwiese.py
```
